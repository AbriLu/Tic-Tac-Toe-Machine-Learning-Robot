This repository contains the work involved in the Learner Subsystem Team of the Tic Tac Toe Machine Learning Robot Project.
This project consisted in designing and building a Robot Capable to play the Tic Tac Toe game against a human. Each time the 
robot loses or wins a game, reinforcement learning algorithms are implemented to penalise the robot (after losing) or reward it (after winning)
such that the winning moves are encouraged but the losing ones are less likely to be made by the robot.

Note that five subsystems made up the whole system of the robot but only one subsystem's work is implemented in this repository; the Learner Subsystem's
implementation, since I was part of the Learner Subsystem Team (and Interface specification Team).

The Leaner Sub-system was to be an autonomous subsystem capable of making it possible for the whole system to learn how to play the Tic Tac Toe game, 
utilising the reinforcement strategies to determine the best possible moves for a win. The sub-system was be able to interact with the user to define 
the learner laws that were be utilised to optimise the probability of success for each move.
